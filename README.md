# simple_reactive
A naive reactive implementation in pure javaScript



Many modern javaScript frameworks implement the idea of reactive programming.

As an exercise for me to understand the idea better I decided to make a minimal implementation using just javaScript and HTML.  No additional frameworks or libraries were used.

This implementation was inspired by the VueJS framework.



The code is shared [here](https://playcode.io/2215603) so you can see it working and play with it.
